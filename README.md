# magnet/rbac

A Clojure library designed to provide role-based access control (RBAC). 

With this library, access to resources would be provided through assigned or prohibited permissions to roles. At the same
time, these permissions could be leveraged at different context levels where resources could be placed. 

This infrastructure is developed to offer a proper complete and simple rbac functionality.
